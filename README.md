### 3. 📈 Churn Prediction for SaaS
**Problem:** Identify at-risk customers early to activate retention interventions  
**AI Approach:** Gradient boosting (XGBoost) + fairness analysis + business outcome sim  
**Key Skills:** Model tradeoffs, metrics, intervention design, responsible AI  
**Impact:** Designed to save $500K ARR through targeted retention campaigns  
**Repository:** [churn-prediction-ai-pm](https://github.com/Usha2025-git/churn-prediction-ai-pm)  
**Artifacts:**
- Product spec (how CSMs use predictions, intervention workflow)
- Metric plan (precision, recall, fairness by segment)
- Business case (intervention cost vs saved ARR)
- Responsible AI section (bias detection, fairness tradeoffs)

### 4. 🏥 Medical AI Assistant (Triage & Clinical Support)
**Problem:** Improve triage accuracy and reduce clinician cognitive load  
**AI Approach:** Multi-agent system with safety guardrails + regulatory compliance  
**Key Skills:** Responsible AI, regulatory thinking, safety & reliability  
**Impact:** Designed for 92% triage accuracy with zero hallucinations on critical cases  
**Repository:** [medical-ai-assistant-pm](https://github.com/Usha2025-git/medical-ai-assistant-pm)  
**Artifacts:**
- Product spec (clinician workflows, safety-critical UX)
- Responsible AI framework (bias in training data, explainability)
- Regulatory checklist (FDA, HIPAA, liability)
- Launch readiness document (validation, monitoring, rollback)

## 💡 What I Demonstrate Across Projects

### 🔍 Problem Framing & User Research
- Clear articulation of business context and user pain points
- User segmentation and Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework
- Market sizing and opportunity assessment

### 🧠 AI/ML Literacy (Product-First)
- Understanding when AI is the right solution vs rules/heuristics
- Model tradeoffs: simple vs complex, open-source vs API, latency vs accuracy
- Evaluation frameworks: offline metrics, online experiments, guardrails
- Cost-benefit analysis (compute, data labeling, inference latency)

### 📊 Metrics & Experimentation
- Product metrics tied to business outcomes (revenue, retention, engagement)
- Model metrics (precision, recall, AUROC, fairness)
- A/B test design and sample size calculation
- Monitoring and alerting for drift and failures

### 🛡️ Responsible AI & Governance
- Bias detection and mitigation strategies
- Explainability and interpretability considerations
- Privacy and data governance (GDPR, data retention)
- Regulatory compliance (where applicable)
- Human-in-the-loop safeguards and escalation paths

### 🤝 Cross-Functional Collaboration
- How I work with ML engineers (framing, trade-offs, constraints)
- Design partnerships (UX for AI, transparency, trust)
- Stakeholder management (sales, legal, ops)
- Launch and rollout planning

- **PRD.md** – Product requirement document with user stories
- **METRIC_PLAN.md** – Success metrics and evaluation strategy
- **UX_FLOW.md** – User experience flow and UI considerations
- **Code/** – Python notebooks and scripts (models, evaluation, analysis)
- **Docs/** – Diagrams, regulatory docs, safety frameworks

To explore a project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Usha2025-git/[project-name]
cd [project-name]
cat README.md
```

## 📖 How to Use This Portfolio

**For Hiring Managers:**
1. Start with a project that matches the role (recommender → backend focus, chatbot → LLM focus, churn → metrics focus)
2. Read the README for business context and PM thinking
3. Check PRD.md and METRIC_PLAN.md to see my product rigor
4. Review code notebooks for technical depth

**For Interview Prep:**
- "Design an AI feature for X" → Use a relevant project as your template and adapt
- "How do you evaluate an LLM?" → Reference the chatbot project's eval plan
- "Tell me about tradeoffs" → Use real tradeoffs from the recommendation or churn project
